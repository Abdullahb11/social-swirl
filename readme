# Node.js Express API for User Management

## Overview

This project implements a basic RESTful API using Node.js and Express to manage user data in-memory. It provides endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user resources.

## Features

- **GET /users**: Fetches a list of all users stored in memory.
- **GET /users/:id**: Retrieves a single user by their ID.
- **POST /users**: Creates a new user with a unique ID.
- **PUT /users/:id**: Updates an existing user's information.
- **DELETE /users/:id**: Deletes a user by their ID from the in-memory storage.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust routing and middleware features.
- **JSON**: Data interchange format used for communication between client and server.
- **Postman**: Uses postman to verify endpoints
